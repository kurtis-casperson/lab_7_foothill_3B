# Imagine an accounting routine used in a book shop. It works on a list with sublists, which look like this:

# Order Number    Book Title and Author              Quantity     Price per Item

# Write a Python program, which returns a list with 2-tuples. Each tuple consists of the order number and 
# the product of the price per item and the quantity. The product should be increased by $10 if the value of 
# the order is smaller than $100,00. Your Python program must use lambda and map.


orders = [
    (1, 30, 2),

result = list(map(lambda order: (order[0], (order[1] * order[2]) + 10 if order[1] * order[2] < 100 else order[1] * order[2]), orders))

I used the slice method to create 2 tuples in the list. Otherwise I had a hard time trying figure out how to 
use lambda and map to have two tuples in the list
